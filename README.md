## Overview

The idea was to create an application for sharing tips. The calculator works based on the amount of the bill, the number of people and the selected tip value in percents.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
